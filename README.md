# cpp-mfc-fractal-art-iec-lgp

Interactive Evolutionary Computation for Fractal Arts using Linear Genetic Programming and MFC.

The basic principle is to use linear genetic program to generate fractal arts which will then submit for user to evaluate, and the evaluation process then assign the fitness for the each linear genetic program generated based on the art work created by them.

The generated linear programs can be exported as either 

* xml or 
* source code or
* compiled executables. 

The fractal arts they create can also be exported as image.

The project was written using MFC in VS 2005 with SDL 1.2 and Allegro. There is an embedded compiler than automatically converts the generated linear genetic program into executable.

The binary executable built from the project can be found in the
